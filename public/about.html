<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Kaka Divine, and I am a dedicated parasitologist with a deep passion for understanding the complex relationships between parasites and their hosts. With a background in biology and a specialization in parasitology, I have devoted my career to studying the fascinating and often misunderstood world of parasites..</p>
<p>My Journey
 <br> My journey into the field of parasitology began during my undergraduate studies when I became captivated by the intricate life cycles and survival strategies of parasites. This fascination led me to pursue a Master's degree in Parasitology at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, where I conducted research on Malaria Parasites.

<p>Research Interests
  <br>My research interests include:
  
 <br> Host-Parasite Interactions: Exploring the dynamic interactions between parasites and their hosts to understand how parasites adapt and evolve.
 <br> Disease Ecology: Investigating the ecological and environmental factors that influence the transmission and distribution of parasitic diseases.
 <br> Molecular Parasitology: Utilizing molecular techniques to uncover the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that underpin parasitic infections.

<p>Outreach and Education
  <br>Beyond my research, I am passionate about educating others about the importance of parasitology. I regularly engage in outreach activities, including [specific activities such as public talks, workshops, or teaching], to raise awareness about parasitic diseases and promote scientific literacy.</p>
